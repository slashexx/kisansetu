      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to KisanSetu, a government initiative dedicated to
        strengthening India’s agricultural sector by providing farmers with
        direct access to markets. Our platform aims to empower farmers across
        the nation by ensuring fair and transparent trade, removing
        intermediaries, and creating an ecosystem of trust and efficiency in
        the agricultural supply chain.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At KisanSetu, our mission is to facilitate sustainable development
          in the agricultural sector by offering farmers a reliable and
          accessible platform to sell their produce directly to buyers. We are
          committed to promoting rural prosperity by enhancing market access
          and ensuring equitable pricing for farmers, while also delivering
          high-quality produce to consumers.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Through KisanSetu, farmers can register and list their produce on
          the platform, ensuring visibility to a wide range of buyers,
          including wholesalers, retailers, and institutions. Buyers, in turn,
          benefit from direct access to fresh, high-quality produce at
          competitive prices. The platform is designed to support farmers by
          providing:
        <ul>
          <ul><b>Assured Market Access:</b> Farmers have access to a
            nationwide network of buyers, reducing their dependency on
            traditional markets. </ul>
          <ul><b>Fair Pricing Mechanism:</b> Farmers are assured of
            fair and transparent pricing, supported by government guidelines and
            market trends.</ul>
          <ul><b>Simplified Logistics:</b> By connecting directly with
            buyers, farmers can streamline their sales, ensuring efficient and
            timely transactions.</ul>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-block">
        <h2>Government Commitment to Farmers</h2>
        <p>
          KisanSetu reflects the Government of India’s commitment to improving the livelihoods of farmers and ensuring
          their participation in the national economy. By leveraging technology and digital platforms, the government
          seeks to create a sustainable agricultural ecosystem that benefits both farmers and consumers. This initiative
          aligns with the broader vision of achieving food security, rural development, and economic empowerment in the
          agricultural sector.
