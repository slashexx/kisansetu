# Buyer's Perspective in Kisansetu

If a buyer wants to purchase rice from a specific area, they will have access to select the farmer from that particular region. After filtering farmers, the buyer can browse different farmer profiles and choose a farmer based on their preferences.
Once a farmer is selected, the buyer can connect via chat to ask for more specific information about the crops, negotiate prices, and inquire further.
After finalizing the deal, a contract will be provided to both the farmer and the buyer, which will outline:

1. The time period within which the farmer must complete the crop.
2. The buyer's obligation to purchase the crops if they are healthy and in perfect condition after the agreed period.
3. Additional charges such as transportation costs that the buyer will need to cover.
