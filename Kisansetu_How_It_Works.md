# How Kisansetu Works

To start using Kisansetu, users (farmers and buyers) will need to create an account on the platform.
1. After logging in, a separate dashboard will be created for both buyers and farmers. Buyers can choose the crops they want to buy and can even opt to buy from a specific area's farmers.
2. Once the buyer selects a particular farmer, they can connect via chat to discuss important details like price, the time required for the crop to grow, etc.
3. After finalizing the deal, a contract will be raised, confirming that the buyer will purchase the crop once it is fully grown and healthy.
4. With the help of an automated payment process integrated into the smart contract system, payments are ensured to be made on time, reducing financial uncertainty for farmers.
5. The final payment will include additional charges such as transportation and any other legitimate costs that the farmer demands and the buyer agrees to.
