# Website Overview

## Project Name: Kisansetu

**Purpose:** This website is developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024 to address problem statement 1640, titled "Assured Contract Farming System for Stable Market Access." The platform is designed to connect farmers with buyers, facilitating assured contract farming agreements, and ensuring stability in market access for farmers.
